// Shared API utility functions
// This file is currently reserved for future shared API utilities
// Individual modules (auth.js, etc.) handle their own API calls

// Example utilities that could be added here in the future:
// - Global error handling
// - Response interceptors
// - Request timeout handling
// - API response caching
